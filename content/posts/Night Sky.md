What is the serenity that falls with the night? What is the wonder that catches our eye with every twinkle of a star? What is the beauty that draws us again into that good night?

Look above; there's a lion within the stars claiming his part of the sky with a majestic pride. Look again; there's Orion and his dog, hunting a bull, tales of our ancestors etched in the domes of heaven. And then there's the inseparable Castor and Pollux, known for their ventures together, set on the sky by the mighty Zeus himself. Like a Shakespearian drama, there are tales of romance, heroism, betrayal, war, bloodshed, and death in the night sky. These stories add a complex layer of perception to the visual beauty of the blinking stars in a dark void. They are reminiscent of the history of humanity and the cultures that prevailed. They remind us of our ancestors' lives, sharing tales like these around bonfires at night. 

There's a sense of peace and calmness often found in the night in contrast to the hectic day. Daytime is painful, bleeding with battles from within and outside, crammed with tight schedules, deadlines, and dues. Some days suck the blood out of the bones. Some other leaves us stranded in an arid desert. And there are days which leave us broken, loathing, and in pity. Those nights, we stroll out, tired, to free the demons trapped inside and mute the bees' buzz in our heads. Those nights, when the cool breeze gently kisses the hair, rejuvenating us with the ticklish warmth of its cold embrace, we are alive again.
