  abstract = {For any fixed \textdollar k\textdollar , a remarkably simple single-tape Turing machine can simulate \textdollar k\textdollar  independent counters in real time. Informally, a counter is a storage unit that maintains a single integer (initially 0), incrementing it, decrementing it, or reporting its sign (positive, negative, or zero) on command. Any automaton that responds to each successive command as a counter would is said to simulate a counter. (Only for a sign inquiry is the response of interest, of course. And zeroness is the only real issue, since a simulator can readily use zero detection to keep track of positivity and negativity in finite-state control. In this paper we describe a remarkably simple real-time simulation, based on just five simple rewriting rules, of any fixed number \textdollar k\textdollar  of independent counters. On a Turing machine with a single, binary work tape, the simulation runs in real time, handling an arbitrary counter command at each step. The space used by the simulation can be held to \textdollar (k+\textbackslash epsilon) \textbackslash log\_2 n\textdollar  bits for the first \textdollar n\textdollar  commands, for any specified \textdollar \textbackslash epsilon > 0\textdollar .},

A natural question is whether extendibility could still hold for positive maps satisfying stronger conditions, such as being unital and norm 1. Here we provide three counterexamples showing that positive norm-one unital maps defined on an operator subsystem of a matrix algebra cannot be extended to a positive map on the full matrix algebra. The first counterexample is an unextendible positive unital map with unit norm, the second counterexample is an unextendible positive unital isometry on a real operator space, and the third counterexample is an unextendible positive unital isometry on a complex operator space.},

@article{Mollo2023,
  abstract = {The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks has sparked a lively debate on the nature of their capabilities. Unlike humans, these models learn language exclusively from textual data, without direct interaction with the real world. Nevertheless, they can generate seemingly meaningful text about a wide range of topics. This impressive accomplishment has rekindled interest in the classical \textquotesingle Symbol Grounding Problem,\textquotesingle  which questioned whether the internal representations and outputs of classical symbolic AI systems could possess intrinsic meaning. Unlike these systems, modern LLMs are artificial neural networks that compute over vectors rather than symbols. However, an analogous problem arises for such systems, which we dub the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two primary objectives. First, we differentiate various ways in which internal representations can be grounded in biological or artificial systems, identifying five distinct notions discussed in the literature: referential, sensorimotor, relational, communicative, and epistemic grounding. Unfortunately, these notions of grounding are often conflated. We clarify the differences between them, and argue that referential grounding is the one that lies at the heart of the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on theories of representational content in philosophy and cognitive science, we propose that certain LLMs, particularly those fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), possess the necessary features to overcome the Vector Grounding Problem, as they stand in the requisite causal-historical relations to the world that underpin intrinsic meaning. We also argue that, perhaps unexpectedly, multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for referential grounding in artificial systems.},

  abstract = {For an open quantum system to evolve under CPTP maps, assumptions are made on the initial correlations between the system and the environment. Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving (HPTP) maps are considered as the local dynamic maps beyond CPTP. In this paper, we provide a succinct answer to the question of what physical maps are in the HPTP realm by two approaches. The first is by taking one step out of the CPTP set, which provides us with Semi-Positivity (SP) TP maps. The second way is by examining the physicality of HPTP maps, which leads to Semi-Nonnegative (SN) TP maps. Physical interpretations and geometrical structures are studied for these maps. The non-CP SPTP maps \textdollar \textbackslash Psi\textdollar  correspond to the quantum non-Markovian process under the CP-divisibility definition (\textdollar \textbackslash Psi = \textbackslash Xi \textbackslash circ \textbackslash Phi\^{}{-1}\textdollar , where \textdollar \textbackslash Xi\textdollar  and \textdollar \textbackslash Phi\textdollar  are CPTP). When removing the invertibility assumption on \textdollar \textbackslash Phi\textdollar , we land in the set of SNTP maps. A by-product of set relations is an answer to the following question -- what kind of dynamics the system will go through when the previous dynamic \textdollar \textbackslash Phi\textdollar  is non-invertible. In this case, the only locally well-defined maps are in \textdollar SN\textbackslash backslash SP\textdollar , they live on the boundary of \textdollar SN\textdollar . Otherwise, the non-local information will be irreplaceable in the system\textquotesingle s dynamic.   With the understanding of physical maps beyond CPTP, we prove that the current quantum error correction scheme is still sufficient to correct quantum non-Markovian errors. In some special cases, lack of complete positivity could provide us with more error correction methods with less overhead.},

@article{Han2023,
  abstract = {For a class of linear maps on a von Neumann factor, we associate two objects, bounded operators and trace class operators, both of which play the roles of Choi matrices. Each of them is positive if and only if the original map on the factor is completely positive. They are also useful to characterize positivity of maps as well as complete positivity. It turns out that such correspondences are possible for every normal completely bounded map if and only if the factor is of type I. As an application, we provide criteria for Schmidt numbers of normal positive functionals in terms of Choi matrices of \textdollar k\textdollar -positive maps, in infinite dimensional cases. We also define the notion of \textdollar k\textdollar -superpositive maps, which turns out to be equivalent to the property of \textdollar k\textdollar -partially entanglement breaking.},

A typical example is the space of continuous functions on a compact space.

Consequently, we can learn features of data efficiently and adapt the models to problems continuously. We apply our framework to practical problems such as density estimation and few-shot learning and show that our framework enables us to learn features of data even with a limited number of samples. Our new framework highlights the potential possibility of applying the theory of \textdollar C\^{}\ast \textdollar -algebra to general neural network models.},

This provides a mathematical explanation for the emergence of Fourier features -- a ubiquitous phenomenon in both biological and artificial learning systems. The results hold even for non-commutative groups, in which case the Fourier transform encodes all the irreducible unitary group representations. Our findings have consequences for the problem of symmetry discovery. Specifically, we demonstrate that the algebraic structure of an unknown group can be recovered from the weights of a network that is at least approximately invariant within certain bounds. Overall, this work contributes to a foundation for an algebraic learning theory of invariant neural network representations.},

@article{Armenta2021,
  abstract = {In this work, we show that neural networks can be represented via the mathematical theory of quiver representations. More specifically, we prove that a neural network is a quiver representation with activation functions, a mathematical object that we represent using a network quiver. Furthermore, we show that network quivers gently adapt to common neural network concepts such as fully connected layers, convolution operations, residual connections, batch normalization, pooling operations and even randomly wired neural networks. We show that this mathematical representation is by no means an approximation of what neural networks are as it exactly matches reality. This interpretation is algebraic and can be studied with algebraic methods. We also provide a quiver representation model to understand how a neural network creates representations from the data. We show that a neural network saves the data as quiver representations, and maps it to a geometrical space called the moduli space, which is given in terms of the underlying oriented graph of the network, i.e., its quiver. This results as a consequence of our defined objects and of understanding how the neural network computes a prediction in a combinatorial and algebraic way. Overall, representing neural networks through the quiver representation theory leads to 9 consequences and 4 inquiries for future research that we believe are of great interest to better understand what neural networks are and how they work.</jats:p>},
